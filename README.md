Password Vault 2019 is a password, credit/debit/other charge card and secure note manager. It leverages python, flask, html, sqllite and some javascript. When a user registers an account a Fernet key is generated and stored in the database. This key is used to encrypt and decrypt passwords, credit card numbers, cvv codes and secure notes.
